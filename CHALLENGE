Programming Task

 

Using a programming language of your choice, spend 1-2 hours writing an application to get and store Massachusetts school ranking data from https://www.schooldigger.com

·      Store a school’s id and name, and any other data you think is useful

·      Store rankings from the past 5 years

If you don’t have time to implement and save to a database, minimally write the SQL code to do the insertions and include in your deliverable the DDL for the db design &/or schema diagrams.

The expectation is not that the application will necessarily be complete, but that you are prepared to discuss your code, design decisions, and next steps.

Deliverable (please send in advance of interview):

·       Code files

·       Instructions for running

·       What would you add or do differently if you had more time?
